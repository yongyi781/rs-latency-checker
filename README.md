# rs-latency-checker: Latency checker for RuneScape
To use it, compile the program, and optionally edit worlds.txt to include worlds you want to test. Each line in worlds.txt should be of the form "world [tabs or spaces] server name". Then, run RSLatencyChecker.exe.
For oldschool worlds, the world numbers are typically something like oldschool61.
Sometimes, main servers for worlds are offline and the alternate server is used, and this would be specified as e.g. world15a.
