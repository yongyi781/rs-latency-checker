# rs-latency-checker
This is a latency checker for RuneScape.

## How to use
To use it, compile the program, and optionally edit `worlds.txt` to include worlds you want to test. Each line in worlds.txt should be of the form `world [tabs or spaces] server name`. Then, run `RSLatencyChecker.exe`.
For oldschool worlds, the world numbers are typically something like `oldschool61`.
Sometimes, main servers for worlds are offline and the alternate server is used, and this would be specified as e.g. `world15a`.
